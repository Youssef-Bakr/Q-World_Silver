# [QWorld](https://qworld.net)'s Silver-QCourse511

Silver is QWorld's intermediate level tutorial on quantum computing and programming focusing on complex numbers, QFT and Shor's Algorithm.

**Silver-QCourse511** is a version of Silver prepared to be used during [QCourse511-2](https://qworld.net/qcourse511-2/). It uses [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq/) as the quantum programming framework. It was adopted from [Silver-MindQuantum](https://gitlab.com/qworld/silver-mindquantum).

Silver is a collection of Jupyter notebooks, and each notebook has many programming tasks to provide hands-on experiences. It is a continuation of [Bronze](https://gitlab.com/qworld/bronze-qiskit), in which the basics of quantum computing and quantum programming were introduced as well as basic quantum protocols and Grover's search algorithm. Silver covers complex numbers, the Bloch sphere, quantum operators, quantum Fourier Transform, quantum phase estimation, and Shor's factoring algorithm. Check [the list of workshops using Silver](https://qworld.net/qsilver/#list) under QWorld.

## Prerequisite

The prerequisite for Silver is having completed the Bronze material or a similar course.

## Silver-Cirq's sections

- Basics (complex numbers, mathematical notation, quantum states and unitary operators)
- Bloch Sphere (global and relative phase, unique represenation, basics of Bloch sphere)
- Complex-valued quantum operators 
- Quantum Fourier transform, phase estimation, and order finding algorithm
- Shor's algorithm for prime factorization

## Credits

Most of the <font style="color: #A9A9A9;"><b><i>Silver</i></b></font> is prepared under the project QPool2019 [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/qkitchen/qpool2019) in 2019-2020 and it is expected to have contributions from public as well.

The MindQuantum adaptation with a major revision was done by Abuzer Yakaryilmaz during Summer 2022. 

The Cirq adaptation was done by Claudia Zendejas-Morales in October 2022, and then it was revised by Abuzer Yakaryilmaz.
